Microbial communities are fundamental to ecosystem functioning, driving processes such as nutrient cycling, organic matter decomposition, and ecosystem resilience. Advances in metagenomics and large-scale environmental DNA sequencing have revolutionized our ability to study these communities, enabling unprecedented insights into their diversity, function, and biogeography. Our work leverages these tools to unveil the complexities of symbiotic interactions, the structure of microbial communities, and the ecological significance of rare taxa across diverse ecosystems, focusing on the critical role of microbial communities in shaping the biology and ecology of diverse ecosystems, from mangroves to coral reefs.

### Adaptive capacity of ecological systems


Complex adaptive systems (CASs) are highly sensitive to both the magnitude and rate of environmental change, with rapid shifts often leading to destabilizing rate-induced transitions (RITs). In this project we investigate how rates of change interact with system dynamics, revealing critical thresholds and vulnerabilities, particularly in the Anthropocene era of accelerating environmental shifts. By analyzing RITs in networks and predator-prey dynamics, this work highlights the role of system connectivity and adaptability in resilience, providing tools to predict and mitigate vulnerabilities in ecological and socioecological systems.

### Coral reefs in the era of global warming


Coral reefs rely on a symbiotic relationship between reef-building corals and photosynthesizing dinoflagellates, which supply up to 90% of the corals' nutritional needs. However, rising global temperatures disrupt this symbiosis, leading to coral bleaching and threatening reef ecosystems. The resilience of coral reefs to climate change varies due to differences in coral morphotypes, symbiotic strategies, and regional conditions. While some corals can adapt through shifts in symbionts or evolving thermal tolerance, others remain vulnerable. In this project we investigate the interplay between eco-evolutionary dynamics and environmental changes in shaping the likelihood of critical transitions in coral reefs. We aim to advance our understanding of coral reef vulnerability and resilience, offering theoretical frameworks to predict and mitigate the impacts of climate change on this ecosystem.
